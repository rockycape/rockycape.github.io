    Still Watching Is Back for Succession's Grand Finale

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Vanity Fair's TV podcast returns to cover the Emmy-winning drama, whose fourth and final season premieres Sunday. Spring is in the air, and it's time to pick an heir. Succession returns for its fourth and final season on Sunday, March 26th---and Still Watching, Vanity Fair's TV analysis podcast, is all over it. Hosts Richard Lawson and Chris Murphy will dive deep into the final 10 episodes of the Emmy-winning series---which remains as "sleek and engaging" as ever in its last round, according to Lawson's review. We'll be unpacking everything from deliciously devastating Roy family drama to the show's greatest one-liners and sharpest insults. "What is the moral of the story for Succession?" asks Murphy on Still Watching. The answer may depend on ends up in charge of Waystar Royco by series' end. Throughout the season, Lawson and Murphy will make their predictions as to who, if anyone, will inherit the WayStar Royco throne, while also interviewing key members of the cast and crew. The beginning of the end for Succession kicks off this Sunday, with a brand new episode of Still Watching dropping right after the episode airs. Tune in, or in the words of Logan Roy, "F--- off."

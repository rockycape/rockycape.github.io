Parents pay top dollar to send their kids to Melbourne's most elite private schools, where fees for year 12 can be as high as $40,000.

The top 20 richest schools in the state have $1bn in the bank between them for capital works and are busy commissioning top architectural firms to deliver polo pavilions, indoor aquatic centres and wellness hubs offering "spaces for possibility".

But all the extracurricular offerings and prestige pays off, with some of Melbourne's most prominent personalities hailing from these exclusive institutions.

Here's the Herald Sun's Who's Who of Private Schools: Part One

#SCOTCH COLLEGE

With the departure of Tom Batty, new principal Dr Scott Marsh -- aka Colonel Sanders -- has taken over. Marsh's more traditional approach to hairstyles ("no mullets") is putting some parents offside.

Scotch has put the botched appointment of Matthew Leeds behind it, but deep problems remain at Victoria's oldest school. "They are eating themselves alive," one alumnus says.

Board chair Alex Sloan remains unpopular with some of the old boys and parents, with many objecting to his "word soup" response to the Presbyterian Church's comments about gay students.

Notable alumni: Michel Nehme, Jamarra Ugle-Hagan, Reef McInnes, Maurice Rioli, Peter Singer, John Williamson, Jeff Kennett, John Cain, Cyril Rioli, Campbell Brown, Jack Billings and Jack Sinclair. Oh, and 71 old boys who have been knighted.

#MELBOURNE GRAMMAR

Affable principal Phillip Grutzner has been a popular, if "reasonably safe" leader.

Grutzner's only liability is his status as a "serial principal" with a crowded CV, with recent positions at Carey Grammar, St Peter's in Adelaide and Braemar College.

But the fact that he's an old scholar may keep him at this prestigious school, also known as the "academy for footballers".

Many were impressed by year 12 student Daniel Cash talking about being supported as a gay school captain.

But one old boy is frustrated by the school's "super woke agenda".

"You can get woke for free at a state school, you don't need to pay $50,000 a year for it," he said.

Movers and shakers include Andrew Michelmore, Jim Cousins, chair of the august Witherby Tower Society Committee and Rev Dr Philip L Freier.

Notable alumni: Professor Richard Larkins, Ted Baillieu, Sir Rupert Hamer, Keith Dunstan, Barry Humphries, Rob Stich and Tom Hawkins.

#TRINITY GRAMMAR

The buzz about newish principal Adrian Farrer is positive, with a number saying he's working well with Mark Glover as the business manager.

Farrer, who went to Melbourne Grammar, is described as "kind" and "empathetic" and "quite vanilla" by parents.

The school has rebounded well from the infamous haircut saga which saw the previous council stand down former deputy principal Rohan Brown.

The previous push to increase the school size was now abated, although some are unhappy with constant demands for donations and bequests.

One parent said the school needed to "stopping worrying about pretty flowers -- get my son out of the portables and hire some more decent teachers".

Movers and shakers include new council chair Ashley Butler, former council chair John Gillam, James Brown, Leigh Hodges, and former leaders Rohan Brown and Rick Tudor.

Notable alumni: Mark Birrell, Luke Power, Sam Power, Peter Rowsthorn, Phil Anderson and Ross Stevenson.

#XAVIER COLLEGE

Things have turned around for the signature Catholic school, which was losing enrolments to schools on the other side of the river despite its reputation as the top of the Catholic pecking order.

Xavier sold Kostka Hall in Brighton and is now concentrating on the Kew campus, with an impressive new building attracting students "from the north side of the Eastern Freeway" as one insider says.

Principal William Doherty has "overseen important change" it's said.

But Bill is not liked by everyone.

"He's too intellectual," one parent said. "He's a very sweet man but some of the parents wish he'd write shorter emails."

Movers and shakers include board chair Tony Nunan, Father Chris Middleton, Gerard Healy and former 3AW boss Shane Healy, who's known as "The Fixer".

Notable alumni: Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman, James Gobbo, Rob Hulls, Tim Fischer, Santo Cilauro, Jobe Watson and Bill Shorten.

#MARCELLIN COLLEGE

After suffering for decades as a bit of a thuggish sporty school for boys whose parents couldn't afford Xavier, Marcellin has had a resurgence under principal Marco Di Cesare.

Another leading principal said Di Cesare and his new deputy Nicholas Moloney were seen as "very good, very caring guys".

"The school is down to earth with good values and a very progressive principal. The boys are very respectful of the leadership," he said.

The full story of what happened to former Marcellin deputy principal Adriano Di Prato -- who was hired then not hired by Melbourne High -- has yet to be revealed.

Movers and shakers include old scholar Bobby Zagame, the Dimattina coffee family and the Carbone family.

Notable alumni: Professor Ben Cowie, Marcus Bontempelli, Callum Brown, Gavin Brown, Stephen Curry and Michael O'Brien.

#RUYTON GIRLS' SCHOOL

An exclusive girls' school in Kew known for strong multi-generational enrolments dominated by blondes. Its size means it lacks some opportunities but its connection to nearby Trinity Grammar gives it additional subject choice (and dating options).

Known as a sporty school that's "great to have on your resume", the feeling is that principal Linda Douglas is doing a good job ably supported by deputies Lauren Perfect and Cathryn Furey.

Movers and shakers include Virginia McLaughlin, board chair Craig Wishart, Tim Rowler, Phoebe Juebner, Annabel Dundas, Nicole Bridmead and Bridget Langley.

Notable alumni, or as Ruyton calls them, women of significance include Sue Carr, Fay Marles, Professor Adrienne Clarke, Judith Durham, Michelle Grattan and Dame Zara Holt.

#LORETO MANDEVILLE HALL TOORAK

Known as the most prestigious of the Catholic girls' schools in Melbourne, Loreto Toorak is very well regarded.

"If you want your kids to rub shoulders with the Toorak elite then this is where you send your daughters," one private school parent said. "It's very well put together."

Principal Angela O'Dwyer has been getting rave reviews. "Great job, everyone loves her," says one school insider.

O'Dwyer's good relationship with the board, led by Louis Chiam, is a big plus.

The board has a number of new faces and its strength is that "it's not one of those places where you get a tap on the shoulder or donate and you get a spot".

Movers and shakers include director of operations Adrian Flanagan, Kate Collins, Andrew Tanner, Suzanne Branton and Bec Carnovale.

Notable alumni: Olivia Wells, Angie McMahon, Catherine Walter, Elizabeth Curtain, Janet Whiting and Meribel Lennon.

#METHODIST LADIES' COLLEGE

With more than 2000 pupils, MLC is often criticised for being too big. But that doesn't stop this Kew institution from having a waiting list a mile long.

The school is now two principals on from the fiasco which led to the sudden departure of long-serving leader Rosa Storelli, who has always maintained she did nothing wrong.

The new principal Julia Shea, an Adelaide import, is viewed as a "total contrast to Diana Vernon", the immediate past principal.

"She's great, she wears pants -- she's not sitting with her legs neatly crossed on the stage," one parent said.

With great VCE results and a strong community, this is where the girls from the eastern suburbs high-end families end up. However, the pressure to succeed and very high expectations are too much for some.

Movers and shakers include the Fox family granddaughters, board chair Simon Martin, Dr Susan Dickinson, Gabrielle Lim, Carmel Mulhern, Ahmed Fahour, Bernard Salt, Belinda Probert and Angela Dally.

Notable alumni: Lady Millie Peacock, Nicola Roxon, Cate Blanchett, Alisa Camplin, Yumi Stynes and Deborra-lee Furness.

#GEELONG GRAMMAR

One mum says Geelong Grammar's parent cohort is "happy and down-to-earth" but it's easy to be affable when your beachside country retreat is valued at $20 million.

Principal Rebecca Cody is widely admired for her open and direct approach to former survivors of child sex abuse from the school. School insiders say she's good to work with and well liked by the students.

Cody continues to be tested by ongoing claims, including one from Sam Newman's son.

Despite having some of the highest fees in the country and extras such as an equestrian program, Geelong Grammar remains highly sought-after.

Movers and shakers include Rupert Murdoch's nephew Paddy Handbury, Tim Fairfax, Joanna Murray-Smith and Penny McBain.

Notable alumni: King Charles, Rupert Murdoch, Kerry Packer, Missy Higgins and Portia de Rossi.

#WESLEY COLLEGE

Principal Nick Evans enjoys broad support in the school community although there are some pockets of deep discontent and some trouble brewing.

Many parents respected the "front-on" way he approached allegations of sexual abuse from female students by male students back in 2021.

"He's doing much better than the last one," one parent said. "But he does seem a bit focused on gender issues."

Perhaps that is because he needs to be.

Prominent among the Wesley community is Frank Colli, a generous benefactor. Colli donated money for a new hall and is known for his flamboyant style.

Movers and shakers include Professor Rachel Webster, Dr John Schubert, Peter Harrison, Craig Joel and the Delis, Tomkins and McGee families.

Notable alumni: Sir Robert Menzies, Frank Beaurepaire, Sharelle McMahon, Ross Oakley, Michael Klim, Ian Johnson, Andrew Westacott and Harold Holt.

#ST KEVIN'S COLLEGE

At the height of St Kevin's problems back in 2020 after the ABC exposed serious problems dealing with sex abuse claims, the school had 34 teachers under investigation.

Most were smart enough to leave.

Principal Deborah Barker is still cleaning up the mess, with some saying she's doing well, and others saying she's not doing well enough.

Perhaps more important than having the first female principal is the impact of school council boss Paul O'Malley, chair of the Commonwealth Bank. "How hard can the Comm Bank be after St Kevin's?" one commentator put it.

O'Malley is leading the school's separation from the Christian Brothers, a move supported by many.

The loss of former acting principal John Crowley is still being felt. Sidelining him because his previous school (St Pat's in Ballarat) wasn't academic enough was shortsighted, some feel.

There is optimism about the school's future. "Everyone has gone now that had to go," one insider said.

Movers and shakers include Paul O'Malley, Evan Dwyer, Kevin Culliver and John Murray.

Notable alumni: Jacob Elordi, Josh Giddey, Rob Sitch, Vance Joy, Tom Liberatore, Brad Scott, Chris Scott and Chet Faker.

#GENAZZANO FCJ COLLEGE

The up-market Catholic girls' school has long been regarded as second in status to Loreto (but ahead of Siena College and Our Lady of Sion College), despite its $32,000 a year fees.

New principal Loretta Wholley is shaking things up. Wholley came in January 2021 after a prestigious career in Catholic education.

"She's divine" says one parent. "She's re-energised the school in a positive way."

The school suffered through Covid, losing enrolments from families opting for cheaper schools in the area -- like Siena and Sion.

Movers and shakers include board members Frank Fucile, Robert MacIsaac, Bernadette Batten and Tony O'Callaghan.

Notable alumni: Kathryn Fink, Philomene Tenni, Rosemary Thomas, Brenda Niall and Judy Ryan.

#BRIGHTON GRAMMAR

It's hard to find a bad word said about Brighton Grammar principal Ross Featherston. "He's running hot. He's right up there with the top two or three APS heads," a former APS principal said.

APS stands for Associated Public Schools, an elite group of 11 private (not public) schools. It's rumoured Featherston was headhunted by two other big boys' schools but chose to stay at Brighton. "Their year 12 results were the best ever. He's really improved the profile of the school," the past head said.

One parent acknowledged Featherston was "not pissing anyone off" which is about as good as the praise gets in private schools these days.

Movers and shakers include board chair Peter Ickeringill, Mike McGrath, Amanda Banfield, Lizzy Badge and Alexandra Dever.

Notable alumni: Dylan Alcott, Guy Rundle, Warwick Capper, Simon Crowe, Julian Clarke, Rennie Ellis, Charlie Pickering and David Smorgon.

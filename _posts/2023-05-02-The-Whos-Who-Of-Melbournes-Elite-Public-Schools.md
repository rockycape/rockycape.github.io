Parents pay top dollar to send their kids to Melbourne's most elite private schools, where fees for year 12 can be as high as $40,000.

The top 20 richest schools in the state have $1bn in the bank between them for capital works and are busy commissioning top architectural firms to deliver polo pavilions, indoor aquatic centres and wellness hubs offering "spaces for possibility".

But all the extracurricular offerings and prestige pays off, with some of Melbourne's most prominent personalities hailing from these exclusive institutions.

Here's the Herald Sun's Who's Who of Private Schools: Part One

## Scotch College

With the departure of Tom Batty, new principal Dr Scott Marsh -- aka Colonel Sanders -- has taken over. Marsh's more traditional approach to hairstyles ("no mullets") is putting some parents offside.

Scotch has put the botched appointment of Matthew Leeds behind it, but deep problems remain at Victoria's oldest school. "They are eating themselves alive," one alumnus says.

Board chair Alex Sloan remains unpopular with some of the old boys and parents, with many objecting to his "word soup" response to the Presbyterian Church's comments about gay students.

Notable alumni: Michel Nehme, Jamarra Ugle-Hagan, Reef McInnes, Maurice Rioli, Peter Singer, John Williamson, Jeff Kennett, John Cain, Cyril Rioli, Campbell Brown, Jack Billings and Jack Sinclair. Oh, and 71 old boys who have been knighted.

## Melbourne Grammar

Affable principal Phillip Grutzner has been a popular, if "reasonably safe" leader.

Grutzner's only liability is his status as a "serial principal" with a crowded CV, with recent positions at Carey Grammar, St Peter's in Adelaide and Braemar College.

But the fact that he's an old scholar may keep him at this prestigious school, also known as the "academy for footballers".

Many were impressed by year 12 student Daniel Cash talking about being supported as a gay school captain.

But one old boy is frustrated by the school's "super woke agenda".

"You can get woke for free at a state school, you don't need to pay $50,000 a year for it," he said.

Movers and shakers include Andrew Michelmore, Jim Cousins, chair of the august Witherby Tower Society Committee and Rev Dr Philip L Freier.

Notable alumni: Professor Richard Larkins, Ted Baillieu, Sir Rupert Hamer, Keith Dunstan, Barry Humphries, Rob Stich and Tom Hawkins.

## Trinity Grammar

The buzz about newish principal Adrian Farrer is positive, with a number saying he's working well with Mark Glover as the business manager.

Farrer, who went to Melbourne Grammar, is described as "kind" and "empathetic" and "quite vanilla" by parents.

The school has rebounded well from the infamous haircut saga which saw the previous council stand down former deputy principal Rohan Brown.

The previous push to increase the school size was now abated, although some are unhappy with constant demands for donations and bequests.

One parent said the school needed to "stopping worrying about pretty flowers -- get my son out of the portables and hire some more decent teachers".

Movers and shakers include new council chair Ashley Butler, former council chair John Gillam, James Brown, Leigh Hodges, and former leaders Rohan Brown and Rick Tudor.

Notable alumni: Mark Birrell, Luke Power, Sam Power, Peter Rowsthorn, Phil Anderson and Ross Stevenson.

## Xavier College

Things have turned around for the signature Catholic school, which was losing enrolments to schools on the other side of the river despite its reputation as the top of the Catholic pecking order.

Xavier sold Kostka Hall in Brighton and is now concentrating on the Kew campus, with an impressive new building attracting students "from the north side of the Eastern Freeway" as one insider says.

Principal William Doherty has "overseen important change" it's said.

But Bill is not liked by everyone.

"He's too intellectual," one parent said. "He's a very sweet man but some of the parents wish he'd write shorter emails."

Movers and shakers include board chair Tony Nunan, Father Chris Middleton, Gerard Healy and former 3AW boss Shane Healy, who's known as "The Fixer".

Notable alumni: Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman, James Gobbo, Rob Hulls, Tim Fischer, Santo Cilauro, Jobe Watson and Bill Shorten.

## Marcellin College

After suffering for decades as a bit of a thuggish sporty school for boys whose parents couldn't afford Xavier, Marcellin has had a resurgence under principal Marco Di Cesare.

Another leading principal said Di Cesare and his new deputy Nicholas Moloney were seen as "very good, very caring guys".

"The school is down to earth with good values and a very progressive principal. The boys are very respectful of the leadership," he said.

The full story of what happened to former Marcellin deputy principal Adriano Di Prato -- who was hired then not hired by Melbourne High -- has yet to be revealed.

Movers and shakers include old scholar Bobby Zagame, the Dimattina coffee family and the Carbone family.

Notable alumni: Professor Ben Cowie, Marcus Bontempelli, Callum Brown, Gavin Brown, Stephen Curry and Michael O'Brien.

## Ruyton Girl's School

An exclusive girls' school in Kew known for strong multi-generational enrolments dominated by blondes. Its size means it lacks some opportunities but its connection to nearby Trinity Grammar gives it additional subject choice (and dating options).

Known as a sporty school that's "great to have on your resume", the feeling is that principal Linda Douglas is doing a good job ably supported by deputies Lauren Perfect and Cathryn Furey.

Movers and shakers include Virginia McLaughlin, board chair Craig Wishart, Tim Rowler, Phoebe Juebner, Annabel Dundas, Nicole Bridmead and Bridget Langley.

Notable alumni, or as Ruyton calls them, women of significance include Sue Carr, Fay Marles, Professor Adrienne Clarke, Judith Durham, Michelle Grattan and Dame Zara Holt.

## Loreto Mandeville Hall Toorak

Known as the most prestigious of the Catholic girls' schools in Melbourne, Loreto Toorak is very well regarded.

"If you want your kids to rub shoulders with the Toorak elite then this is where you send your daughters," one private school parent said. "It's very well put together."

Principal Angela O'Dwyer has been getting rave reviews. "Great job, everyone loves her," says one school insider.

O'Dwyer's good relationship with the board, led by Louis Chiam, is a big plus.

The board has a number of new faces and its strength is that "it's not one of those places where you get a tap on the shoulder or donate and you get a spot".

Movers and shakers include director of operations Adrian Flanagan, Kate Collins, Andrew Tanner, Suzanne Branton and Bec Carnovale.

Notable alumni: Olivia Wells, Angie McMahon, Catherine Walter, Elizabeth Curtain, Janet Whiting and Meribel Lennon.

## Methodist Ladies' College

With more than 2000 pupils, MLC is often criticised for being too big. But that doesn't stop this Kew institution from having a waiting list a mile long.

The school is now two principals on from the fiasco which led to the sudden departure of long-serving leader Rosa Storelli, who has always maintained she did nothing wrong.

The new principal Julia Shea, an Adelaide import, is viewed as a "total contrast to Diana Vernon", the immediate past principal.

"She's great, she wears pants -- she's not sitting with her legs neatly crossed on the stage," one parent said.

With great VCE results and a strong community, this is where the girls from the eastern suburbs high-end families end up. However, the pressure to succeed and very high expectations are too much for some.

Movers and shakers include the Fox family granddaughters, board chair Simon Martin, Dr Susan Dickinson, Gabrielle Lim, Carmel Mulhern, Ahmed Fahour, Bernard Salt, Belinda Probert and Angela Dally.

Notable alumni: Lady Millie Peacock, Nicola Roxon, Cate Blanchett, Alisa Camplin, Yumi Stynes and Deborra-lee Furness.

## Geelong Grammar

One mum says Geelong Grammar's parent cohort is "happy and down-to-earth" but it's easy to be affable when your beachside country retreat is valued at $20 million.

Principal Rebecca Cody is widely admired for her open and direct approach to former survivors of child sex abuse from the school. School insiders say she's good to work with and well liked by the students.

Cody continues to be tested by ongoing claims, including one from Sam Newman's son.

Despite having some of the highest fees in the country and extras such as an equestrian program, Geelong Grammar remains highly sought-after.

Movers and shakers include Rupert Murdoch's nephew Paddy Handbury, Tim Fairfax, Joanna Murray-Smith and Penny McBain.

Notable alumni: King Charles, Rupert Murdoch, Kerry Packer, Missy Higgins and Portia de Rossi.

## Wesley College

Principal Nick Evans enjoys broad support in the school community although there are some pockets of deep discontent and some trouble brewing.

Many parents respected the "front-on" way he approached allegations of sexual abuse from female students by male students back in 2021.

"He's doing much better than the last one," one parent said. "But he does seem a bit focused on gender issues."

Perhaps that is because he needs to be.

Prominent among the Wesley community is Frank Colli, a generous benefactor. Colli donated money for a new hall and is known for his flamboyant style.

Movers and shakers include Professor Rachel Webster, Dr John Schubert, Peter Harrison, Craig Joel and the Delis, Tomkins and McGee families.

Notable alumni: Sir Robert Menzies, Frank Beaurepaire, Sharelle McMahon, Ross Oakley, Michael Klim, Ian Johnson, Andrew Westacott and Harold Holt.

## St Kevin's College

At the height of St Kevin's problems back in 2020 after the ABC exposed serious problems dealing with sex abuse claims, the school had 34 teachers under investigation.

Most were smart enough to leave.

Principal Deborah Barker is still cleaning up the mess, with some saying she's doing well, and others saying she's not doing well enough.

Perhaps more important than having the first female principal is the impact of school council boss Paul O'Malley, chair of the Commonwealth Bank. "How hard can the Comm Bank be after St Kevin's?" one commentator put it.

O'Malley is leading the school's separation from the Christian Brothers, a move supported by many.

The loss of former acting principal John Crowley is still being felt. Sidelining him because his previous school (St Pat's in Ballarat) wasn't academic enough was shortsighted, some feel.

There is optimism about the school's future. "Everyone has gone now that had to go," one insider said.

Movers and shakers include Paul O'Malley, Evan Dwyer, Kevin Culliver and John Murray.

Notable alumni: Jacob Elordi, Josh Giddey, Rob Sitch, Vance Joy, Tom Liberatore, Brad Scott, Chris Scott and Chet Faker.

## Genazanno FCJ College

The up-market Catholic girls' school has long been regarded as second in status to Loreto (but ahead of Siena College and Our Lady of Sion College), despite its $32,000 a year fees.

New principal Loretta Wholley is shaking things up. Wholley came in January 2021 after a prestigious career in Catholic education.

"She's divine" says one parent. "She's re-energised the school in a positive way."

The school suffered through Covid, losing enrolments from families opting for cheaper schools in the area -- like Siena and Sion.

Movers and shakers include board members Frank Fucile, Robert MacIsaac, Bernadette Batten and Tony O'Callaghan.

Notable alumni: Kathryn Fink, Philomene Tenni, Rosemary Thomas, Brenda Niall and Judy Ryan.

## Brighton Grammar

It's hard to find a bad word said about Brighton Grammar principal Ross Featherston. "He's running hot. He's right up there with the top two or three APS heads," a former APS principal said.

APS stands for Associated Public Schools, an elite group of 11 private (not public) schools. It's rumoured Featherston was headhunted by two other big boys' schools but chose to stay at Brighton. "Their year 12 results were the best ever. He's really improved the profile of the school," the past head said.

One parent acknowledged Featherston was "not pissing anyone off" which is about as good as the praise gets in private schools these days.

Movers and shakers include board chair Peter Ickeringill, Mike McGrath, Amanda Banfield, Lizzy Badge and Alexandra Dever.

Notable alumni: Dylan Alcott, Guy Rundle, Warwick Capper, Simon Crowe, Julian Clarke, Rennie Ellis, Charlie Pickering and David Smorgon.

1854 Words

Welcome to the second instalment of the Herald Sun's Who's Who of Private Schools.

With yearly fees heading towards $40,000 a year at the top colleges, parents are paying closer attention than ever to how their schools are performing.

Principals these days aren't just educators -- the best ones are running businesses with annual incomes of $138m and grounds worth $258m.

Post-Covid, the private school landscape continues to evolve, leading to a shift away from girls' schools which means larger co-ed schools are starting to dominate.

Here's the Herald Sun's Who's Who of Private Schools: Part Two


## Carey Grammar

As one of the only co-ed schools in the leafy east's private school belt, Carey Grammar is "going gangbusters" according to one insider.

"The principal Jonathan Walters is doing a good job and surrounding himself with excellent people," one staff member said.

This includes head of senior school Kellie Lyneham, who has a strong background in girls' education.

The proudly progressive Walter, who came back to the school in 2020, is becoming well known for his Instagram account, giving him the nickname JWalt.

Carey is sailing well, and after a challenging period a few years ago, the Old Carey Grammarians organisation is now productive, with members of all ages feeling heard.

Movers and Shakers: Tim Chilvers, Mary Wooldridge, Graeme Liebelt, Jane Favaloro, Anthony and Nicola Bergelin, Sam Ponsford, Ash Mehta and Rob Coombes.

Notable alumni: James Tomkins, Steve Vizard, Jack Macrae, John and Tom Elliott, Peter and Tim Costello, Tiffany Cherry and Suzie Wilks.

## Caulfield Grammar

Known as the sportiest school among some very sporty schools, Caulfield Grammar is the Carey Grammar of the southeast, hoovering up sporting talent thanks to a raft of generous scholarships.

The facilities at the school's Wheelers Hill campus are next-level and the new six-level teaching and learning building is costing $80m -- four times the annual budget of many high schools.

Principal Ashleigh Martin has held the post since 2017 and many believe is doing a good job promoting school values and academic success. However, the school's success -- 3228 students and counting -- is coming at the expense of local residents and a number of smaller schools in the area such as Shelford Grammar.

The school's sporting ethos and win-at-all-costs mentality also makes it unpopular among some of its competitors.

Movers and shakers: Andrew Aitken, Emily Davis, Henry Jones, Fleur Katsmartin, Jim Hayman, Adrian Redlich, Richard Jones, Louisa Durbin.

Notable alumni: Hamish Blake, Nick Cave, Kelly O'Dwyer, Emily Angwin, Jack Rafshauge, Mack Horton, Tamsyn Lewis, Brett Deledio, Chris Judd, Christopher Skase, Matthew Wales, John Landy, Tony Beddison.

## The Knox School

The school was founded in 1982 and is going through a turbulent time.

Revelations that many long-serving members of the school council have been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to run the school -- a job that others do for free elsewhere -- has rocked this tight-knit college.

With relatively low fees compared to other eastern suburbs private schools, The Knox School has grown in recent years, but a high turnover of staff continues to cause instability. As one former staff member put it: "the school was an absolute nightmare to work at but I loved the kids".

Movers and shakers: Wendy Lewis, Barry McIlwaine, Cathrine Burnett-Wake, Ted Gale, Genia Janover, Craig Spagnol, Sandra Ball.

Notable alumni: Jackson Irvine, Shanae Greaves, Xander Speight, David Glascow, Victoria Caetano, Mitchell Phelan and Bhavesh Kapadia.

## St Catherine's School

Stability of leadership has been a boon for this high-end, successful sporty school. Principal Michelle Carroll has been at the helm for a decade and worked hard to overcome a "Mean Girls" reputation a few years ago.

One St Cath's old girl said the school "used to be full of girls from Toorak whose dads had a lot of money and didn't care what they did".

Now St Catherine's calls itself the "number one girls' school in Victoria" off the back of its impressive VCE results and prestigious Henley Royal Regatta rowing win in 2022.

It's an approach that hasn't impressed other top-performing girls' schools.

An all-female leadership team, campus in the heart of leafy Toorak and cashed-up parent body all make St Catherine's one of the state's most impressive schools.

Movers and shakers: Jane Hodder, Roxanne Ktenevos, Tom Shelton, Julia Soutter, Maryann Jesudason, Marnie Pringle, Irene Karas, Scott Reinke, Kirsty-Manning Wilcox, Annabel and Rupert Myer, Sarah O'Brien, Jamie and Rebecca Gray, Simone and Andrew Demetriou.

Notable alumni: Natalie Bloom, Lady Anna Cowen, Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, Lady Marigold Baillieu Southey, Sunday Reed, Linda Dessau, Lauren Hewitt, Celia Burrell, Jane Campton, Carolyn Cresswell, Sophie Mirabella, Susan Richardson, Flip Shelton.

## Haileybury

Haileybury's is one Victoria's largest schools and it's capably led by Derek Scott -- only the eighth principal since 1892.

Despite balancing multiple sites across the city, including the state's first online private campus (which charges nearly $20,000 a year), Haileybury manages to avoid some of the gender, race and sexual skirmishes of other top-drawer private schools.

Impressive grounds -- especially its Keysborough campus which stretches for more than 2km along Springvale Rd -- and further international expansion will see the school's 4432-student headcount rise in coming years.

But the school's relentless pursuit of academic and sporting excellence comes at a cost.

"High achievers will love Haileybury -- everyone else, not so much," one former parent said.

The school was also fined $140,000 over safety breaches after a groundsman suffered a fatal head injury when he was struck by a tree.

Mover and shakers: Russell Davidson, Neil Sutcliffe, Tom Poulton, Scott Doran, Scott Pendlebury, Nathan Jones, Matthew Lloyd.

Notable alumni: Maddison Connaughton, Barbara van der Merwe, Adam Elliot, Ross Wilson, Ian Henderson, Lex Lasry, Martin Pakula, Alice Burke, James Pattinson, Amy Lawton, Ty Vickery, Max and Ben King, Andrew Brayshaw, Angus Brayshaw, Luke Davies-Uniacke, Cody Weightman, Jack Gunston, Oscar Piastri.

# Ballarat Clarendon College

The mid-priced rural college in Victoria consistently posts some of the very best academic results, topping the state in 2022 for VCE.

The school hit the headlines in October last year after staff revealed a long list of grievances to the Herald Sun, accusing long-serving principal David Shepherd of bullying and harassment.

Staff reported a culture of "genuine misery" thanks to the crippling workload.

"Shepherd was very strong, maybe too strong, but the school has unbelievably good results. He drives staff very hard," one insider said.

There were investigations galore. However, Shepherd was cleared by an independent panel.

But no one was surprised when he decided to retire after a 27-year stint in the top job at the fifth-oldest private school in the state.

The school was lauded this year for winning Head of the Lake, won by both the girls' and boys' teams for the first time ever.

Movers and shakers: David Shepherd, John Livingston, Fiona May, Mark Patterson, Jacqui Sewell, Stuart Postlethwaite, Jen Bourke, Greg Ashman, Mehdi and Colleen Qerim, Warwick and Megan Read, Victoria and Rod Kennedy, Jane and Ashley Miller.

Notable alumni: Matt Olver, Gwyn Hanssen Pigott, Joe Saba, Kimberley Davies, Bill Hunter, John Button, Percy Beames, Alastair Clarkson, Hugh McCluggage, Sarah Heard, Bob Davis, Georgina Kemp.

## Mentone Grammar

In a move still having repercussions around the southern beachside suburb, Mentone Grammar decided to admit girls in 2006.

Its sister school, Mentone Girls' Grammar, had rejected a merger proposal the year before.

The decision was controversial and opposed by many parents at the time.

It caused the departure of the school's principal which led to the appointment in 2007 of Mal Cater in the top job. An old scholar, Cater has been there ever since, but will leave at the end of 2023 after deferring his retirement in 2020.

"Mal handled the move to co-ed well at Mentone Grammar," another principal said.

"He's set the school up for the future very well."

The school is dealing with some historic sexual abuse claims, and was condemned for sacking staff during Covid, with Cater offering satirical prayers which didn't go down well.

Movers and shakers: Simon Appel, Mark Henricks, Jon Ponnusamy, Georgia Ahern, Ross Joblin, Kylie Watson-Wheeler, Sally Buckley, Natalie Burrows, Kate Edwards, Hayden McNamara, Molly Grant, Niki Buschkuehl, Robina Shearer, Lisa Kirwan.

Notable Alumni: Shane Warne, Stan Alves, Bill Granger, Mal Walden, Kate Hore, Oliver Florent, Jared and Daniel Daperis, Lee Cormie.

## Mentone Girls' Grammar School

Three years ago, Natalie Charles, formerly head of Carey Grammar senior school, took over as principal at Mentone Girls.

"Nat" is proving to be a confident and effervescent leader. But the school has been struggling with declining enrolments also affecting a number of high-end private girls' schools. "Everyone wants bigger schools, and over time the smaller ones are just getting smaller and smaller," another principal said.

Fifteen years after going co-ed, Mentone Grammar has 1770 students and Mentone Girls' Grammar has around 600.

Mentone Girls' is also at war with neighbours who are objecting to the opening of its $15m wellness precinct -- which includes an indoor pool -- to non-student groups.

The school recently refinanced five prestigious beachfront properties in a bid to expand its premises along the foreshore, but is not in a position to proceed with developing them.

Movers and shakers: Courtney Walsh, Caitlin Cole, Chrissy Slater, Daphne Soh-Simpson, Penelope Morey-Siemering, Tiffany Middleton, James Stewart, Amanda Robertson, Dr Heather Schnagl and Nicole O'Donnell.

Notable Alumni: Margaret McLorinan, Annette Kellerman, Nancy Wynne Bolton, Dulcie Boling, Mary Bawden, Sarah Derrington, Nicole Bradtke, Suzie Sheehy, Neary Ty.

## Fintona Girls' School

The up-market Balwyn college has excellent VCE results, but small year 12 cohorts and only 450 students across all year levels

The school's reputation has been helped by revelations in 2022 that students had been complaining for some years about the "non-sexual physical conduct" of former deputy principal Sarah Carter.

An investigation led to Ms Carter leaving the school, but the fallout is continuing, with principal Rachel Falloon currently on sabbatical. The deputy principal and acting head Mark Geraerts is described by one staff member as a "breath of fresh air".

Movers and shakers: Jackie Besley, Catherine Vickers-Willis, Alison Rodriquez, Jane Rodgerson, Claire Levi, Michael Lee, Jason Karamentos, Andrea Phillips.

Notable alumni: Lucinda Hartley, Joanna Syme, Dame Beryl Beaurepaire, Helen Caldicott, Andrea Coote, Dame Pattie Menzies, Dora Mary Lush, Louise Bawden, Dr Bronwyn King, Dr Gael Jennings, Jill Sewell, Olivia Cranwell, Georgia Griffith.

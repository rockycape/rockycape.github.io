***Getting around***


At first in the game you can't hail cabs.  After completing "Bull in a China shop" mission you can hail cabs and hire them being charged based on distance.

LB (left bumper) - When on foot LB is whistle to hail a cab.  Next hold Y-button to get into the cab. Note this is different from pressing Y-button which hijacks the cab.  Doesn't matter if the cab is already occupied as you frighten the previous passenger out.

When you are further along in the game, Roman will give you a call to say you can now call him and he will send his cab to you and drive you where you need to go - no charge!   The explanation brief is "Roman now likes you a lot - you can use his special ability. You can call up Roman and select "Car Service" he will send you one of his cabs to pick you up and take you to destinations around the city."

**GTA vehicle spawn codes**

NB: Comments for this story confirm that using some of these cheats will not allow you to unlock certain achievements.

Having a tough time getting your revenge on in Liberty City? Thankfully Game Trailers user [GhettoChild](http://www.gametrailers.com/player/usermovies/212611.html) discovered the cheat codes in *[Grand Theft Auto IV](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/gtaiv)* for everything from restoring health to spawning an Annihilator helicopter. Using the in-game cell phone you dial the phone numbers to activate the code. While we haven't been able to confirm it, we assume using any cheats will no longer allow you to unlock any achievements and based on Rockstar's past with using codes, you may be unable to watch the final cinematic in the game.

Don't say we didn't warn you. Codes after the jump.


How to use the cheats:\
Press up on your D-Pad to display your cell phone, and then press up again to access the keypad. Enter the codes and call the number. If done correctly, it should say "Cheat activated" in the top left hand corner.

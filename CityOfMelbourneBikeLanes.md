The City of Melbourne is fast-tracking the delivery of 40 kilometres of kerbside protected bike lanes and pedestrian improvements across the city.

The new bike lanes will connect into Melbourne's existing bike lane network and provide a safe, efficient, sustainable transport alternative that will support physical distancing and get the city moving again as COVID-19 restrictions are eased.

The new lanes are key routes identified in City of Melbourne's [Transport Strategy 2030](https://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/parking-and-transport/transport-planning-projects/Pages/transport-strategy.aspx).

Works began in 2020 and are being delivered in two stages. 

Round one bike lanes include: 

Abbotsford Street, Albert Street, Canning Street, Exhibition Street (stage 1), Peel Street, Rathdowne Street, Swanston Street, William Street and footpath extensions on Spencer Street. 

Round 2 bike lanes include: 

Bourke Street, Exhibition Street (stage 2), Flinders Street, La Trobe Street, Nicholson/Spring Street, Queens Bridge Street, Royal Parade, Spring Street, St Kilda Road and Whiteman Street. A full list of completed and in progress works is available below.

This project is being delivered by the City of Melbourne and the Victorian Government through the $100 million Melbourne City Recovery Fund.

Welcome to this CoderDojoBalwyn website.  CoderDojo is a free coding club for kids 7-17 and CoderDojoBalwyn was our local group in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia through to the end of 2022.

As of 2023 CoderDojoBalwyn no longer has a local group meetup after Boroondara Libraries decided to run STEM for kids in-house.

CoderDojoBalwyn thanks Boroondara Libraries for providing a room at Balwyn Library and ticketing over the years.

Below is a screenshot of the CoderDojoBalwyn website which was used to promote the club.

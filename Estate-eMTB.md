*Battery Details*

Reention EEL MINI 36v 10ah battery

Note: There is a physically larger battery called the Reention EEL PRO and this form factor is too large and does not fit the Estate eMTB.  There is also a larger capacity battery than origianlly supplied with Estate eMTB that fits and it is still 36V but is 14ah up from 10ah

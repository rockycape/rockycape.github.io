Let's start with the battery as it is probably the most expensive part that like all batteries goes end-of-life as it has a known limitied number of recharge cycles. After a limited number of recharge ccycles the battery will not hold enough charge to power the eMTB motor effectively.

*Battery Details*

Reention EEL MINI 36v 10ah battery - this is the battery that is originally supplied with the Estate eMTB  

Note: There is a physically larger battery called the Reention EEL PRO and this form factor is too large and does not fit the Estate eMTB.  There is also a larger capacity battery than origianlly supplied with Estate eMTB that fits and it is still 36V but is 14ah up from 10ah

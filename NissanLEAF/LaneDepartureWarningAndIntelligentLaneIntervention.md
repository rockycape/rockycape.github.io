On the Australian Nissan LEAF, what is the difference between the following two similar safety functions?  
(a) LANE DEPARTURE WARNING (LDW) SYSTEM  
(b) INTELLIGENT LANE INTERVENTION (ILI) SYSTEM  

---

On the Australian Nissan LEAF, the **difference between LANE DEPARTURE WARNING (LDW) and INTELLIGENT LANE INTERVENTION (ILI)** comes down to whether the system just warns you or actively intervenes:

---

### (a) Lane Departure Warning (LDW)

**Function:**  
LDW **alerts** the driver when the vehicle unintentionally drifts out of its lane **without using a turn signal**.

**How it works:**

- Uses a front-facing camera to detect lane markings.
- If the system detects that the car is drifting from the lane, it gives an **audible and/or visual warning** (e.g., beeping or a warning icon on the dash).
- It does **not take control** of the steering or brakes.

**Driver responsibility:**  
The driver must take corrective action themselves.

---

### (b) Intelligent Lane Intervention (ILI)

**Function:**  
ILI **actively assists** in steering the vehicle back into the lane **if the driver doesn’t respond** to a lane departure warning.

**How it works:**

- Builds on LDW.
- Uses the same camera to monitor lane markings.
- If the car begins to drift out of its lane and the driver doesn’t respond, the system will:
	- Apply **gentle braking** on specific wheels to steer the car back,
	- Or **gently adjust steering** (depending on model and year).
- Helps **keep the car centered** within the lane.

**Driver responsibility:**  
Still remains with the driver, but this system provides **hands-on corrective support**.

Syncthing setup for mobile device after setting up computer device

1. Assuming you've setup Syncthing on your computer first,
2. then you'll start Syncthing-computer client and open Syncthing within your browser 
3. then install then open syncthing-android client on your mobile
4. and next find the mobile device-id within syncthing-android
5. and next add this mobile device-id to syncthing-computer
6. and then you need to accept (choose yes or no) on the syncthing-android device
7. by going into **Syncthing** → tap **≡ → Web GUI**.

This last step is not obvious and might catch you out if you don't look in the menu structure of the synthing-android app for Web GUI!
